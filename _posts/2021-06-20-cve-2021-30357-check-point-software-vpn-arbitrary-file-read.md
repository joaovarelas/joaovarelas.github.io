## Description

The software Check Point VPN SNX (SSL Network Extender) client v800007075 for Linux installer sets SUID bit causing it to run as a privileged used on the system. It also has an information leak vulnerability that could be leveraged to partially read any file on the system by specifying its filepath as a VPN configuration file, causing it to throw an exception and print a verbose/debug thus revealing the file contents (e.g. /etc/shadow).
